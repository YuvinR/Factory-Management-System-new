# Factory-Management-System-new

1.added new packages for each member which includes model,servlet,services.(if you want any package you can add it using different name).

2.hope everyone use same util file and dbconnection file inside the util package.

3.everyone should push their db table script file to database folder.

    3a.to add a script file open it from notepad and copy the create database queries and execute it from mysql.
    3b.to give the access of db to ur project, change the user name and pw of DBConnection.java file (change it to your dbname and pw)
    
4.when pushing do not push the dbConnection it may easier others to pull the project and run.

5.THAWA THIBE NM PASSE KATHA KARAMU ...GOOD LUCK!!!!!!
